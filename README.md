# miRNA Biomarkers COVID-19 Detection

## The Problem
Covid-19 is unpredictable. It can hit at any time, at any place. It can bring about a wide array of complications, from breathing trouble, to fevers, to death. Existing health complications, such as lung disease, autoimmune diseases,
and asthma and can exacerbate the severity of the disease. There are unseen conditions within genes that may also contribute. 

Current testing is too simple - it does not give us enough information. We need more informative Covid-19 testing solutions to give us more information and better plan against the disease.

## The Solution
By understanding the what causes varying severity in Covid-19, we can better predict the possibility of a patient requiring intensive care. 

A combination of predictive AI technology and biological understanding allows for a new system which can predict impending severity of a patient's Covid-19 test. 

This facilitates the decision-making process for medical professionals to arrange the most efficient and cost-efficient intervention for each patient., improving overall planning and expectation of a patient, alleviating mental strain that comes with the uncertainty of Covid-19.

## The Mechanism
microRNA (micro ribonuclease) is a cousin of DNA, and exists in our circulating blood. Its presence correlates with the severity of the disease. Therefore, it can be used to predict the risk and severity of Covid-19 symptoms.

To make the unpredictable more predictable, blood microRNA can be used as biomarkers to identify the status of the disease, allowing for better planning and treatment of each patient.

This project utilized machine learning and miRNA sequencing data to develop a predictive algorithm where we input the patient's microRNA sequencing data, the algorithm will assign patients to different severity levels.

The algorithm seeks variations in miRNA between Covid-19 negative patients, Covid-19 mild symptoms, and Covid-19 severe symptoms. It detects the most prominent 100 variations, ranking them by importance. It learns and understands what makes Covid-19 severe.

A patient's Covid-19 test can then be analysed for the presence of these miRNA markers, presenting the level of severity of the patient depending on the severity predicted by the system.

However, no system is without fault. Currently, the system is still gather and learning data. The data required for learning is very specific and requires large amounts of data to become more accurate, therfore it will be constantly learning and updating as it gets better at its job.

# miRNA Biomarkers COVID-19 Detection

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic's unpredictability highlights the need for better testing and prediction methods. To address these limitations, efforts have been made to develop more informative testing solutions. 

Predictive AI technology, combined with biological insights, offers a promising approach to predict the severity of COVID-19 cases. MicroRNA in circulating blood has been identified as correlating with disease severity and can serve as a biomarker for predicting COVID-19 symptoms' risk and severity. 

Despite its potential, this system is still in the data-gathering and learning phase. It requires large amounts of specific data to improve accuracy and will continually update as it learns from new information.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was gathered from:
[Whole transcriptome miRNA profiling of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient plasma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE178246)
